# KaamSetu — Daily Workforce Dispatch & Operations Platform

KaamSetu (*Bridge to Work*) is a real-time daily workforce dispatch platform built for India's unorganized daily-wage market. It connects households and local businesses directly with verified daily-wage workers (painters, plumbers, cleaners, cooks, electricians, gardeners) for immediate daily jobs.

## The Problem & What KaamSetu Solves

### The Problem
Finding reliable daily help for short 1-day tasks (e.g. painting a living room, deep kitchen cleaning, tap repair) in Indian cities remains fragmented:
* **For Households**: Unreliable word-of-mouth recommendations, zero background verification, and arbitrary daily pricing.
* **For Workers**: Unpredictable daily work, middleman commission cuts (up to 30%), and no permanent record or reputation history.

### The Solution
KaamSetu digitizes daily labor dispatch into a clean, mobile-first experience:
1. **60-Second Dispatch**: Households create a daily job posting with task requirements and daily rates. Nearby verified workers receive notifications instantly.
2. **Dual-Mode Architecture**: Users can switch seamlessly between **Employer Mode** (posting jobs) and **Worker Mode** (finding daily work) inside the exact same app session with a single tap.
3. **Direct Connection & Verification**: Worker profiles display Aadhaar verification badges and skill tags. Phone numbers unlock once a worker is assigned to a job.
4. **Transparent Rates**: Jobs list upfront daily pay rates with zero middleman deductions.

## What's Built in the Repo Today

* **Product Landing Screen**: Single-line logo lockup in the top navigation bar, product headline, live trust metrics, and direct entry points to Employer and Worker feeds.
* **OTP Mobile Authentication**: Phone number authentication screen with 6-digit verification code input, countdown resend timers, and toast alert feedback.
* **Dual-Mode Dashboard**:
  * *Employer Mode*: Service marketplace category grid, overview of active postings, category distribution, and job dispatch triggers.
  * *Worker Mode*: Availability status, current sector radius, and expected daily wage rate settings.
* **Job Dispatch Ledger**: Full-screen job search with real-time text query filtering, modal category selector (`AppBottomSheet`), and tabbed status management (`OPEN`, `ASSIGNED`, `COMPLETED`).
* **4-Stage Job Stepper**: Visual progress tracker (`Posted` → `Interested` → `Assigned` → `Completed`) with task specs, applicant worker cards, and sticky bottom action bar.
* **System Profile & Skills Management**: Worker profile editor to toggle availability (`available` / `busy`), customize skill badges via slide-up sheet, view ratings, and access compliance records.
* **Light Theme Design System**: Custom Flutter design tokens (`AppColors.canvas`, `AppColors.surface`, `AppColors.brand`) with strict single-accent color discipline (`#D97706` amber reserved for primary CTAs, active states, and prices).
